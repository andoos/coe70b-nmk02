We suggest that you begin by typing (Brings up development server):

  cd frontend
  npm start

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!


- Images and fonts related to components will be stored under frontend/src/assets 

- Components should be in their own folder under frontend/src and this folder should include the javascript and css files
